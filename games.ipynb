      "Game theory is a mathematical field dealing with the analysis of strategic interactions, of the kind found in games but also in things like economic behavior, international relations, decision makiing under uncertainty and so on. Game theory is a deep and exciting mathematical theory, but some of the elementary notions from game theory are easy to grasp and have become standard terminology in discussions of social behavior. They are often used by philosophers. Moreover, games, in the formal sense of game theory, are very often used as a modeling framework for studying social behavior, and are thus used to discuss justice, fairness, cooperation, norms and so on. \n",

      "A *game* consists of a set of players, a set of possible moves (actions) each player can make, and a payoff function indicating the payoff each player gets depending on the moves made by every player (including herself, of course).

      "### Modelling perspective: interpreting mixed strategies\n",
      "\n",
      "In some games the idea of resorting to a mixed strategy is quite intuitive. If two (or more) possible outcomes seem possible when we consider what the other player might do, it might make sense to randomize so that our cummulative payoff will reflect the relative preference we have for each outcome. It seems this should lead to maximal cummulative payoff (*why?*). The expected payoff of a mixed strategy also agrees nicely with the notion of *subjective expected utility*.\n",
      "\n",
      "A mixed strategy seems to presussopse multiple interactions, rather than a one-shot game. In a sense, then, probability or ranndomness represents time. Alternatively, we can think about mixed strategy as representing interactions in a population. In this model, two agents are chosen at random from the population (accodrding to the mixed strategy probabilities) and are pitted against each other, each playing one of the non-mixed strategies. It is helpful to reflect on the fact that these intrepretations carry with them substantive assumptions about the temporal strcture of the situation or the role and structure of the population. As always, such assumptions are typically not netural with respect to the phenomemon we are studying.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the perspective of the agents randomization can be a method of *confusing* the opponent. It can be used when players are *uncertain* about the other players actions and want to remain \"indifferent\" to their choices (we saw that in coordination games). More fundamentally, mixed strategies may be used not only to represent multiple interactions (repeated games) or interaction with players drawn from a heterogenous population but to handle these situations appropriately.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Food for thought:** In the context of coordination games (in particular) it might be argued that a mixed strategy ensures fairness to some extent since the preferred outcomes of both players will occur, and with the appropriate frequency. Discuss. \n",
